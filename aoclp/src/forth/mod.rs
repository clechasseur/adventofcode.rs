//! Implementation of an interpreter for a simple subset of Forth.
//!
//! Solution to an exercise on the Exercism Rust track: <https://exercism.org/tracks/rust/exercises/forth>
//!
//! # Documentation
//!
//! Because this is a more complex exercise, I decided to properly document the code using [rustdoc](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustdoc/what-is-rustdoc.html).
//! Because of the Markdown, it's sometimes a bit harder to read the doc in the code directly if you're not
//! used to the format. To generate the doc and open it in a browser, use
//!
//! ```sh
//! cargo doc --open
//! ```
//!
//! In order to ensure that all documentation is available when generated, everything in the code is `pub`lic; this would
//! not normally be the case of course.
//!
//! # Interactive Forth
//!
//! To simplify manual testing, an Interactive Forth interpreter is included with the project. To run it:
//!
//! ```sh
//! cargo run --bin if
//! ```
//!
//! # Rustfmt
//!
//! The code has been formatted with the official Rust code formatter, [rustfmt](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustfmt).
//! The submission includes a `rustfmt.toml` file with the settings used for formatting. The settings depend on
//! some unstable features of rustfmt however, so in order to use it, you need a [Nightly Rust toolchain](https://rust-lang.github.io/rustup/concepts/channels.html#working-with-nightly-rust).
//! Then, to use rustfmt, use
//!
//! ```sh
//! cargo +nightly fmt
//! ```
//!
//! # Code coverage
//!
//! The `tarpaulin.toml` file is a configuration file for [tarpaulin](https://github.com/xd009642/tarpaulin), a Rust
//! code coverage tool. It's not necessary to install it to run the tests; I've used it to ensure proper coverage of
//! all test cases. If you do have tarpaulin [installed](https://github.com/xd009642/tarpaulin?tab=readme-ov-file#installation),
//! you can run it for the project using
//!
//! ```sh
//! cargo tarpaulin
//! ```
//!
//! # just
//!
//! I'm a big fan of the [just](https://github.com/casey/just) command runner, so I included the `justfile` I used
//! during development as part of the submission. It's based on a simple [template](https://github.com/clechasseur/rust-template/blob/main/justfile)
//! I use for many of my Rust projects.

    /// ```
    ///
    /// This creates a word called `name` that, when executed, will result in the execution of its corresponding

    /// sequence. Example:
    ///
    /// ```forth
    /// : foo 2 dup ; foo
    /// ```
    ///
    /// will result in the following stack:
    ///
    /// ```forth
    /// 2 2
    /// ```
    ///
    /// Corresponding Rust example:
    ///
    /// ```
    /// use aoclp::forth::Forth;
    ///
    /// let mut forth = Forth::new();
    /// assert!(forth.eval(": foo 2 dup ; foo").is_ok());
    /// assert_eq!(&[2, 2], forth.stack());
    /// ```
    ///
    /// # Redefinitions
    ///
    /// It is possible to define a certain word multiple times. When a word is redefined, any reference to the word
    /// _after that point_ in the sequence will use the new definition, but references to the word _before that point_
    /// will still refer to the previous definition. Example:
    ///
    /// ```forth
    /// : foo 1 ; : bar foo ; : foo 2 ; foo bar
    /// ```
    ///
    /// Here, `foo` is defined twice, but the reference to `foo` inside the definition of `bar` refers to the _first_
    /// definition of `foo`. Thus, the execution of `foo bar` will leave the stack with
    ///
    /// ```forth
    /// 2 1
    /// ```
    ///
    /// Corresponding Rust example:
    ///
    /// ```
    /// use aoclp::forth::Forth;
    ///
    /// let mut forth = Forth::new();
    /// assert!(forth
    ///     .eval(": foo 1 ; : bar foo ; : foo 2 ; foo bar")
    ///     .is_ok());
    /// assert_eq!(&[2, 1], forth.stack());
    /// ```
    ///
    /// # Overriding built-in words
    ///
    /// It is possible to redefine a built-in word, even an arithmetic operator. For example:
    ///
    /// ```forth
    /// 1 2 + : + - ; 3 4 +
    /// ```
    ///
    /// will result in the following stack:
    ///
    /// ```forth
    /// 3 -1
    /// ```
    ///
    /// Corresponding Rust example:
    ///
    /// ```
    /// use aoclp::forth::Forth;
    ///
    /// let mut forth = Forth::new();
    /// assert!(forth.eval("1 2 + : + - ; 3 4 +").is_ok());
    /// assert_eq!(&[3, -1], forth.stack());
    /// ```
    ///
    /// # Definitions within definitions
    ///
    /// It is possible to define a word within the definition to another word[^1]; however, all words are stored in the
    /// dictionary at the same level (e.g. the inner definition will not be scoped to the outer definition only). Example:
    ///
    /// ```forth
    /// : foo : bar 2 ; bar bar ; foo bar
    /// ```
    ///
    /// will rsult in the following stack:
    ///
    /// ```forth
    /// 2 2 2
    /// ```
    ///
    /// Corresponding Rust example:
    ///
    /// ```
    /// use aoclp::forth::Forth;
    ///
    /// let mut forth = Forth::new();
    /// assert!(forth.eval(": foo : bar 2 ; bar bar ; foo bar").is_ok());
    /// assert_eq!(&[2, 2, 2], forth.stack());
    /// ```
    ///
    /// Note however that words are added to the diction when their definition's terminal `;` token is encountered.
    /// Thus, an inner definition will be added to the dictionary _before_ its outer definition. This can be used
    /// to implement seemingly-recursive words:
    ///
    /// ```forth
    /// : foo : foo 2 ; foo ; foo foo
    /// ```
    ///
    /// It seems like this shouldn't work, but when `foo` is encountered in the outer `foo` definition, it will refer
    /// to its inner definition, while the `foo`s outside of both definitions will refer to the outer definition. This
    /// will result in the following stack:
    ///
    /// ```forth
    /// 2 2
    /// ```
    ///
    /// Corresponding Rust example:
    ///
    /// ```
    /// use aoclp::forth::Forth;
    ///
    /// let mut forth = Forth::new();
    /// assert!(forth.eval(": foo : foo 2 ; foo ; foo foo").is_ok());
    /// assert_eq!(&[2, 2], forth.stack());
    /// ```
    ///
    /// # Eager validation
    ///
    /// Existence of words referred to in the sequence is validated when the word is encountered. Thus, an unknown
    /// word will result in an [`Err(Error::UnknownWord)`](Error::UnknownWord), but the rest of the sequence will not
    /// be executed. For example:
    ///
    /// ```
    /// use aoclp::forth;
    /// use aoclp::forth::Forth;
    ///
    /// let mut forth = Forth::new();
    /// assert_eq!(Err(forth::Error::UnknownWord), forth.eval("foo 1 2"));
    /// assert!(forth.stack().is_empty());
    /// ```
    ///
    /// # Case insensitivity
    ///
    /// Words are evaluated in a case-insensitive manner. For example:
    ///
    /// ```
    /// use aoclp::forth::Forth;
    ///
    /// let mut forth = Forth::new();
    /// assert!(forth.eval("1 DUP dup DuP dUp").is_ok());
    /// assert_eq!(&[1, 1, 1, 1, 1], forth.stack());
